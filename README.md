No-Limit Hold 'Em Poker Program

(began on 2018-11-8, completed on [pending])

Note: The hand evaluation functions are designed to find the best possible hand from ANY number of cards (not just 7 cards, which would be the maximum number of cards evaluated per hand in No Limit Hold 'Em). This is for (1) extra protection against bugs, (2) easy testing with large lists of cards (i.e. lists of length > 7), and (3) portability so that the functions can be used to evaluate hands for other variants of poker, which may check more than 7 cards.
